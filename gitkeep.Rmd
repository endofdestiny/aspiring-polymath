Sometimes you want to add an empty diectory to a Git repo but Git won't keep your directory structure intact if there's no file present. The trick around this is to add a hidden file to the repo.


```touch data/.gitkeep```


Here it's called `.gitkeep` but it could be called anything starting with a dot.

To view any hidden files in a directory you can use:


``` ls -a ```
