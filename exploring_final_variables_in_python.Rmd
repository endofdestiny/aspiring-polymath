Put the following code at the end of a python script and it'll open an interactive python console which allows you to explore what variables are in memory at that time.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
from code import interact
interact(local=dict(globals(), **locals()))
```

Very handy if you have lots of variables and are debugging.
