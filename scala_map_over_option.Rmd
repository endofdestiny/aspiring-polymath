title: "Mapping over options in Scala"

As a simple example let's say that we have a map from people to ages.

```
val peoplesAge = Map("John Smith" -> 21, "Kate Tungsten" -> 34, "Fred Upton" -> 62, "Lisa Perry" -> 43 )

```

Now *maps* are treated as functions so to access the value associated with a particular key, you can do this:

```
peoplesAge("John Smith")
```

However, if you try to access a key that doesn't exist e.g. `peoplesAge("Lisa Smith")`, you end up with a `java.util.NoSuchElementException` error.

This can be avoided using `get` which returns an option of either `Some(age)` or a `None`.

You can write a pattern matching function for what to do with these Nones, but if you only want to deal with the values that you actually have keys for then flatMap works great.

```
List("John Smith", "Lisa Smith") flatMap (peoplesAge.get)
```

Will only return `List(21)` , corresponding to John Smiths age.
